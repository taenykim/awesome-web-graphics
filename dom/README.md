# 🕹 DOM

The DOM (Document Object Model) is an API that represents and interacts with any HTML or XML document. The DOM is a document model loaded in the browser and representing the document as a node tree, where each node represents part of the document (e.g. an element, text string, or comment). - [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/DOM)
